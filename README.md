## Description 

This project was to create a CMS style tech blog where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. 

This involved configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

This app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Usage
Start by signing up. Once you are signed up , you can then later login if your session expires.
